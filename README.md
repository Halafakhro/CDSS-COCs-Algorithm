# CDSS-COCs-Algorithm
This system helps clinicians make accurate hormonal treatment decisions, reducing VTE risk. CDSS-COCs evaluate six VTE risk factors  for COCs users. It generates three prescribing alarm messages and uses a four-level decision process to recommend alternative treatments if needed. 
The CDSS-COCs prototype system assesses six key risk factors for Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) in patients considering combined oral contraceptives (COCs). These risk factors include Age ‚â•35, BMI >25, Family History, Smoking, Personal History of VTE, and the genetic factor V Leiden Mutation. Based on these factors, the system generates three distinct alarm messages to guide clinical decisions:

‚ö†Ô∏è Alarm message #1: It‚Äôs time to prescribe the COCs! üíä
‚ö†Ô∏è Alarm message #2: Hey doc, maybe prescribe COCs, but keep an eye on things, yeah? üëÄ
‚ö†Ô∏è Alarm message #3: Whoa there, let‚Äôs check the purpose of the treatment. This message includes eight reasons for the treatment. The user selects one, and the system suggests an appropriate alternative treatment.
Decision Process Structure
The decision-making process in CDSS-COCs is divided into four levels, with the system advancing to the next level if the patient‚Äôs case does not match the current criteria:

Level 1: The system checks the criteria in List 1. If a match is found, Alarm message #3 is triggered. The user then selects the treatment purpose from a list, prompting the system to suggest an alternative treatment.
Level 2: If the patient‚Äôs case does not match List 1, the system evaluates the criteria in List 2. If a match is found, Alarm message #1 is generated, concluding the process.
Level 3: If the patient‚Äôs case does not match List 2, the system examines the criteria in List 3. If a match is found, Alarm message #2 is generated, concluding the process.
Level 4: If the patient‚Äôs case does not match List 3, the system checks the criteria in List 4. If a match is found, Alarm message #3 is generated, and the user proceeds as described in Level 1.

Conclusion
CDSS-COCs is designed to provide clinicians with precise recommendations for hormonal treatment, considering six major risk factors: BMI, Age, Smoking, Personal History of VTE, Family History of VTE, and the genetic factor V Leiden Mutation. By identifying patients at a higher risk of VTE during COCs treatment, the system aims to reduce VTE incidences among COCs users. This structured approach ensures that each patient receives a personalized assessment, leading to safer and more effective treatment decisions.
